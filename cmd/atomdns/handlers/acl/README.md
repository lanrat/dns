# Name

_acl_ - enforces access control policies

# Description

With _acl_, users are able to block or filter suspicious DNS queries by configuring IP filter rule sets, i.e.
allowing authorized queries or blocking unauthorized queries.

When evaluating the rule sets, _acl_ uses the source IP adresss, unless the _ecs_ handler has added an address
to the context.

# Syntax

```
acl {
    ACTION [QTYPE|OPCODE]... [NET]...
    ACTION CTX VALUE...
}
```

- **ACTION** defines the way to deal with DNS queries matched by this rule. The default action is _allow_,
  DNS query not matched by any rules will be allowed to continue. The following actions are defined:
  - _allow_ forward the query to the next handler.
  - _block_ stop the query and return a _refused_ response with the extended error (EDE) 'blocked'.
  - _filter_ stop the query and returns _noerror_ response with the extended error (EDE) 'filtered'.
  - _drop_ stop the query and don't send any reply.

- **QTYPE|OPCODE** is the query type, or opcode to match for the requests to be allowed or blocked. If
  **QTYPE|OPCODE** is omitted it matches _all_ types and opcodes.

- **NET** is the source IP address requests to be allowed or blocked. Typical CIDR notation and single IP
  addresses are supported.

- **CTX** must be used in the format `xxx/yyy`, i.e. two words seperated by a slash. The _geoip_ handler for
  instance writes data under (among other) the key `geoip/city`, that can be used here. If the key does not
  return any data it will considered a positive match and **ACTION** is performed.

- **VALUE** is the value to match **CTX** to. Again with the _geoip_ handler and using `Cambridge` here you
  can have access control on a city level.

# Examples

Block everything.

```conffile
. {
    acl {
        block
    }
}
```

Filter all DNS queries with record type A from 192.168.0.0/16.

```conffile
. {
    acl {
        filter A 192.168.0.0/16
    }
}
```

Block all DNS queries from 192.168.0.0/16 except for 192.168.1.0/24.

```conffile
. {
    acl {
        allow 192.168.1.0/24
        block 192.168.0.0/16
    }
}
```

Drop all queries from Cambridge, this requires the _geoip_ handler to have populated the context for this
query. Allow all countries that are in the EU.

```conffile
. {
    acl {
        block geoip/city Cambridge
        allow geoip/country/eu true
    }
}
```

Drop opcode UPDATE for all but a few IP ranges.

```conffile
. {
    acl {
        allow UPDATE 192.168.1.0/24
        block UPDATE
    }
}
```

# Metrics

If monitoring is enabled (via the _metrics_ handler) then the following metrics are exported:

- `atomdns_acl_blocked_requests_total{zone, network, family}` - counter of DNS requests being blocked.
- `atomdns_acl_filtered_requests_total{zone, network, family}` - counter of DNS requests being filtered.
- `atomdns_acl_allowed_requests_total{zone, network, family}` - counter of DNS requests being allowed.
- `atomdns_acl_dropped_requests_total{zone, network, family}` - counter of DNS requests being dropped.

The `zone`,`network` and `family` labels are explained in the _metrics_ handler documentation. These metrics
follow the _global_'s metric `\N` setup, and as such should be multiplied by `N` to get the actual value.

See atomdns-ecs(7) that can add a better source address.

# Bugs

_acl_ should also check TSIG and other signed messages, see https://codeberg.org/miekg/dns/issues/426 for the
remaining work.
