// Package implement a DNS zone, held in a binary tree. Each RR(set) that gets inserted will need to create
// any empty non-terminals (ENT) it possesses. I.e. inserting www.example.org into example.org is easy, but when
// www.a.b.c.example.org inserts we need to make sure that 'c.example.org', 'b.c.example.org' and
// 'a.b.c.example.org' also exist and are ENTs (have no actual RRs). For deleted the opposite must happen. As
// an example from RFC 4592, the record:  sub.*.example.  TXT  "this is not a wildcard" is a fun one. As this
// means the '*.example' ENT exists meaning that bogus.example. gets a NODATA response instead of NXDOMAIN.
//
// Doing this on insert sucks a bit, but makes the lookup code much more simple (and correct), which is more
// important for a DNS server.
